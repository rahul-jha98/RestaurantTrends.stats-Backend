11,Jannat - Hotel Kanhashyam,2.0,You donot expect this from the only four star hotel of Allahabad Actually the staff never behave like they are a part of a premium hotel We ordered Chicken risotto and chilli paneer from the menu Risotto was good Chilli paneer was average Why I am supposed to pay more when I am getting average food
12,Jannat - Hotel Kanhashyam,5.0,his is the ultimate place to dine with your loved onesexcellent ambience food and servicespecial thanks to Mr Deepak singh and his team for all his service and hospitality
13,Jannat - Hotel Kanhashyam,1.0,Service  Pathetic The manager there had one sole purpose to count number of people Its a fixed menu buffet system where they will serve at table They actually do not serve you because the never repeat a starter If you ask again the waiter will leave to get it but never comes back Horrible fresh fruit juice Eventually when they dont serve you starters willingly you end up asking for main course Same behaviour as before Dishes served just once and if you ask to repeatmultiple requests because they dont hear at first time waiter will hide in a closet and you end with no option but to make compromise with hunger  Now dessert gulab jamun was served so cold as if just out from refrigerator  Food is not even worth Rs 70 and they charge Rs 700plus taxes  Food was absolutely blank in taste Manager looks like a crook and yes he is
14,Jannat - Hotel Kanhashyam,1.0,Went there with good hopes but it turned out to be a nightmare We were seated when the manager after taking our order asked us to vacate the table as he had a reservation which her forgot Very unprofessional and hostile We didnt rise and asked him to serve food We ordered veg Buffett They served cold food and starters were shit Despite ordering veg food they served mutton Precisely NEVER EVER GO TO THIS PLACE

74,Moti Mahal Delux,1.0,
75,Moti Mahal Delux,3.0,decent restaurant catering to the shoppers at the mall Lunch time on a Sunday One would have expected the tables to be occupied but that was not the case Maybe the food had something to do with the occupancy state The tandoori chicken was served as a sizzler with all the trappings that one would expect in a continental sizzler It had sauce all over it come on sauce on a good old desi tandoori chickencould it have been barbeque sauce the chicken too was from a famished brood The taste though not classic tandoor was reasonably ok The chicken in the Butter chicken was well fed but the gravy was work in progress The nan and the rotis were good and the saving grace The TV was too noisymaybe the management could consider playing soft music instead The service was good If one needs a quiet lunch without much ado about the food while at the mall this could be the place

145,Muktanandam Moti Mahal Delux,5.0,
146,Muktanandam Moti Mahal Delux,4.0,Muktanandam Moti Mahal Delux is a well known restaurant in Civil Lines Allahabad especially known for their Non Vegetarian food The place has a very spacious area ample seating and ambient lighting The interiors are splendid  chandeliers on the ceiling lamps on the wall and fine red colored chairs merging very well with the surroundings The tables are laid out in an orderly fashion They have set up a perfect environment for a fine dining experience  I had visited Muktanandam once with my friends during my stay in Allahabad Initially we had ordered half plate Chicken Tikka Masala with breads and Pan Fried Noodles The Chicken Tikka Masala had perfectly grilled pieces of Chicken with a lip smacking gravy Each bite with bread tasted as delicious as anything The Pan Fried Noodles were unusually good in taste for a restaurant specializing in North Indian food Crisp fried noodles topped with Crispy Vegetables and sweet and sour sauce The sauce had perfect balance of flavors We liked them so much that we ordered another plate The only downside was that Chicken Tikka Masala was too less in quantity Half plate was just sufficient for one person Therefore we had to order half a plate of Kadhai Chicken after that The Kadhai Chicken was decent in taste but didnt taste as good as Chicken Tikka Masala which downgraded an overall wonderful experience  Overall a great place to visit for North Indian food and Chicken cravings Would have loved to visit again

219,Nazeer Foods,2.0,i ordered boneless butter chicken 2pcs first of all i would like to mention there is a drastic taste mismatch between nazeer foods delhi and prayagraj Gravy was not upto the mark now chicken pcs they were boiled and added in gravy there was no smoky flavour in chicken which is der in bonless chicken when u eat specially at nazeer food anywhere i was dissapointed because my experience so honestly writing here  i hope you guyz improve and understand your shortcomings Only thing that really impressed me is packaging
220,Nazeer Foods,5.0,
221,Nazeer Foods,4.0,What are you planning for lunch today Recommend this scrumptious lunch at Nazeers Allahabad They have some exciting combo offers running We ordered the combination of Afghani Chicken tikka 3pcs  Khameeri Roti 2 pcs and Beverage of your choice at 189 only Alongside we ordered a Gosht Nihari The Afghani Chicken tikka was soft and creamy with an obvious smoky flavour Taste   The Nihari which is basically a mutton stew was absolutely flavourful I loved it Swipe for a pic of the Nihari Taste   The only problem at this place is the service which is really poor
222,Nazeer Foods,5.0,his place has the best biryani in allahabad I spent last 6 months trying every biryani in allahabad I can and I finally say I found something I like The masala chicken biryani of this place is just a must try
223,Nazeer Foods,5.0,I have tasted most of their items like A fgahani chicken tikkaa mutton nihariseekh kebab and chicken taka ta ka roll etc taste fantastic but today I have ordered chicken tawa changezi no taste only too much salt please add only those dishes in your menu which are awesome in taste not just good stick to your reputation guys

225,Tamboora,3.0,Well its best place for hookaah no doubt But if you want to have some snacks Than its not place for you I have order 2 dish Chilly potato and garlic bread  Chilli potato was good 3 out of 5  Garlic bread was tasting like milklayer is on it Totally waste if money 2 out of 5  Overall 3 out of 5   jst because of hookah Hope they improve it afterwards Thank you Tamboora
226,Tamboora,3.0,his section is on the rooftop of Muktanandam building If you arent a hukkah person its better you visit their food section on 1st floor Cabin is small and congested and the outdoor seating has nothing too catchy earlier it looked better in evening Most of the time it is overcrowded Service is quite slow food is good and for hukkah most of the times they dont have the flavours that you want
227,Tamboora,4.0,his place has the best hukka in the town Soft drinks are also good mocktails and beverages and the coffee is also good And the ambience is also nice in the place

309,Indish,5.0,My first experience with indish wasnt good But since then almost a year today I must say that they have really really improved on their food quality I havent tried the entire menu but I would strongly recommend this place for Chinese food
310,Indish,1.0,I so wish to go back in time and undo visiting this place As I had not been to this place and the urge to try it out compelled me to pay a visit  Nice and simple interior quite and spacious place with comfortable seating Menu is vast and pricing is nominal  I ordered Golden Fry Babycorn Fish Fingers Golden Fry Prawns and Cold Drinks for starter  Waiting time was more than 30 minutes and they served cold drinks without starters Lousy service and lathargic staff also the place is understaffed  After such a long wait cold food was served fish fingers being a little warm Coming to taste nothing tasted good  Disappointed with starters so obviously didnt order main course  Settled the bill and left the place with a mindset of never ever going back What a waste of money and time

471,Aao Ji Haryana Dhaba,2.0,Beyond my expectation it was a quite clean dhaba Although hygiene was doubtful I was expecting the food loaded with oil and butter and was ready for a heavy stomach but surprisingly very less oil was used in their preparation and good to announce that the taste was developed by spices and slow cooking When you r cooking a food with less oil patience is the key to provide the time to spices to release its taste and aroma Although the food was average in taste but four of us satisfied our feast in just rs 485 by ordering one paneer butter masala one mutter  one dal tadka 7 tandoori roti and one plate boile rice What else can we expect in such range Good value for money

899,Raw Palette,4.0,he makers of this place were highly creative and effortful just loved the ambience WE visited this place when covid 19 was at peak but not a single seat was free its trending hot in march 2020 FOod LASAGNEveg 455 very rich n creamy loaded with veggies as u can see in the pictures it takes 40 mins prep but it was worth waiting for PANEER TACO 355 the filling was good n spicy but salad was missing Ps im giving 4 stars not bcoz its a trending one but bcoz the staff was polite and efficient and they offer great variety of things for your cravings

916,UP 70 Restaurant,5.0,small nice and comfortable place with a lot of fancy roof and ceiling its suitable for a get together a party date or a nice cozy dinner or lunch with your family The waiting time for the order to be prepared it is short time but the food is worth the wait Overall a nice and comfortable place to visit
917,UP 70 Restaurant,3.0,Up70 is a catchy name though I feel its motivated from RJ 12 but just name cant take you places seems to be appropriate here as the food I ordered was lacking taste and also the art of cooking I ordered mushroom rogan and daal tadka to treat up my taste buds but to my disappointment the food was tasting everything rather than a freshly prepared one and being a foodie myself I feel that up 70 needs a lot of improvement to make its name tall

1820,Fire at Night,2.0,         I ate it at a fire night restaurant Manchurian was quite good and the quantity was also good And fried rice was also fine And cold coffee was better than average Schewan noodles is okyish Hakka noodles  i didnt like much  Chili Potato  It looks good when you look at the picture But  it was not good at all its smell or maybe it was not fresh And when we complain about it the manager narrates his own story and does not listen to us Service was also not good Very slow service Even we forget what we ordered Fir bhi wo ni aya last tk Disappointed not good experience  i wont recommended this restaurant for food 
1821,Fire at Night,3.0,
1822,Fire at Night,3.0,t fire at night From Starters Drums of heaven is tasty  Panner tikka is also delicious Cold coffee with icecream perfect    But always try starters at fire at night Never try food from Main course except Chilly chicken   The boy who manages dj floor was very disgusting We decided not to go there again As staff behavior was very rude    Staff ka behavior yha ase hote ha ki plz starters or main course sath order kre wrna dj me dance krna allow ni krnge   They will start the DJ according to food we order  What the hell   Now ye hmari first ratings ha ksi post ko Food 35 Ambience 45 Staff behavior 05 Place sahi ha bs staff change krne ki jrurt ha especially the boy who plays songs  From Maine Course Kadhai Panner Butter Chicken and butter naan Murgh dam biryani    We have no words to say that how tasteless these foods are Butter chicken doesnt taste as butter chicken As you look it you already keep your mind set that this is not tasty And its same in taste according to its look  Biryani taste like the masala chicken gravy and rice  Pta hi nahi chal paya ki biryani thi    Never order Main course food from Fire at night Try chilly chicken if you really want something to eat not to waste If you go there give order of starters   And one thing more staff ka behavior dekhke already mood khrb ho jta ha No welcoming nature Full of attitude  Hum foodies ke liye Allahabad me already bhaut acche restaurant ha pleasant staffs ha jaha
1823,Fire at Night,1.0,So recently I visited this place Let me tell you the staff and the manager are very rude And I ordered this particular dish and they served me another dish and then they asked me to pay for it so obviously I denied because its their mistake so they started arguing with me On top of that instead of coming to take the order they called me to the counter to give the order Which is ridiculous And they directly entred the order to the computer and when I wanted to change the order the manager got angry and wasnt ready to listen Overall the washroom are very dirty the washbasin is choked I wouldnt recommend anyone to go to this place Also i ordered a cold coffee of Rs 125 which tasted horrible and it was like there wasnt any milk but only water I could have got a better cold coffee in Rs45 at Subhash Chauraha So the restaurant isnt upto the mark the service is horrible and also expensive

1881,Raju Chicken Shop,1.0,Hi this Raju shop is one of the pathetic shop in Allahabad not giving proper service and food item is not hygienic the cutter is very rod dont trust on them
1882,South Mouth,1.0,Very bad experience They delivered only part of the order Had ordered dosa and curd rice  they forgot to send the curd rice Or may be the delivery boy are it himself may be thats why he was insisting on showing I rate him 5 star on the app before he would hand me the food
1883,South Mouth,4.0,he delivery was very prompt and the masala dosa was completely on point Sambar was perfectly dense and it tasted as if it was prepared in some proper and authentic South Indian eatery very uncommon for the eatries here in Prayagraj that serve south Indian meals The coconut chutney was perfect in terms of the proportion of coconut and the dal which is used to prepare the base of chutney and the overall preparation really complimented the taste of sambar  Although the only drawback here here was in terms of packing the food In order to combat that the restaurant can pack it in such a way that it doesnt become an issue if a person orders it to some place where cutlery isnt available around
1884,Punjabi Tadka,1.0,Very bad quality and no test in foods and packing Is also bad nonveg thali only one dish is non vegg and all the things are same as veg thali

1907,Allahabad Cafe,2.0,My experience over here was not very nice The food they serve is palatable but they arent really fond of hygiene The ambience wasnt nice and the service was slow Prices are fine
1908,Punjabi Dhaba,5.0,heir thali is the most popular and budget friendly item It always had two seasonal vegetable dishes in it which they keep altering every day Taste wise its very good and if I have to compare I would say its close to homemade vegetable dishes For those staying in IIIT this is the closest restaurant offering decent food a nice change from the repititive hostel mess food  The information on Zomato seems to be erroneous The average cost is more like 250 for 2 people not 500 for 2 people
1909,Lazeez Darbar,2.0,Lazeez Darbar is a small restaurant on the Kanpur Road Overall experience 25  Outside Look15 The out side look is pretty shabby Plastic chairs put on the Tandoor Counter It can classify as spot for bachelors or students  Ambience 35 The seating capacity isnt so big 5 tables Bug groups hence cant be accommodated The cleanliness level was upto the mark inside   Service 15 The service is horrible and they are totally alien to the word courteous I had asked for an item on menu which wasnt available with them and i got an angry retort from the manager saying  it takes time in preparation followed by  we actually dont provide this dish as mentioned in the menu  Food  45 Food here generally stands upto the mark Its actually tasty as compared to the same level restaurants in the neighbourhood This is the silver lining to the whole experience
1910,Lazeez Darbar,4.5,his really is not one of the places youd really expect to get great food but go on order out any of their delicacies and youd realize how wrong my first statement  was In fact this really is one of those places youd be amazed dining at  Prices are fairly decentFood is amazingSurely one of the better places to enjoy mughlai delicaciesStaff are niceId recommend you to ask the staff about the foodthey generally make good choices  I am totally in love with their phirni which is a must try when you go there  VerdictThis might not be the perfect place to woo your date but is definitely one of those places you can make the sunday dinner with your bestfriend affordable

2098,H2O Cafe,5.0,this cafe is very pocket friendly in this areaThe food taste is very deliciousthe cheesy pizza still makes my mouth wateringThick shake lovers will get a variety here
2099,H2O Cafe,4.0,his cafe is located in the Vinayak Centre Plaza Civil Lines The place is small in size and can be booked for casual hangouts and parties  We tried their Combo Meal which included a Cheese Burger French Fries and a Coke for only 135 The burger was very tasty and its stuffings were good in quantity We also tried their noodles which were yummy Their biryani too was very good in quantity and worth trying  For drinks we tried their Strawberry Shake which was very good in quantity and delicious  Overall the food was tasty but theres still scope for betterment Enjoyed my visit there

2116,Cravings Food Corner,3.0,Well I was looking for the restaurants to order food  Come across the cravings food corner and after scanning out the reviews ordered Chicken roll and Chicken Burger So Ill restrict my answer to these only  Food things I liked  1 Since being a chicken lover and eating it now over 7 years I can say the chicken was quite fresh and well cooked Yay wont gonna get a stomach ache after eating that  2 Roll was not over oily and filled with mayonnaise Making that quite filling In all I would recommend the roll   3 In Burger the bun was fresh and liked they kept the bun slight raw like the way Mc Donalds do I guess nobody likes the burnt texture of bun which the roadside burger makers do to the bun   4 Packing was also pretty decent    Things they need to improve  1 Lettuce Huge portions of lettuce dont know why  The lettuce was definitely not going well in the chicken roll If why I had to suggest I would removed that lettuce Also due to rising healthfungus issues with lettuce I strongly condemn eating that  2 Roll I found bit small in length and it was not stuffed with as much the quantity of chicken as it should be Might be lettuce has not left the enough place to put adequate chicken in it duh  3 Slightly pricy than the other restaurants and with the amount of quantity was served   Else all in all it was a decent experience I would definitely be ordering again from this restaurant
